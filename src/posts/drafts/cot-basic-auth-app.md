[Cot](https://cot.rs/) is a relatively new rust web framework. However, there are relatively few resources out there on how to build apps with it since I became an active contributor. This blog posts is one of many others to provide concise and intuitive ways of building web apps with cot also while doing my best to demistify some internals of how cot works under the hood.
