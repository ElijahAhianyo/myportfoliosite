Typography is one of the most crucial elements of web design, yet it's often overlooked. The right typography enhances readability, brand identity, and user experience.

> "Typography is the craft of endowing human language with a durable visual form." â€” Robert Bringhurst

## Choosing the Right Fonts  

When selecting fonts for your website, consider the following:  

âœ… **Readability:** Ensure text is legible across all screen sizes.  
âœ… **Brand Identity:** Fonts should reflect your brand's personality.  
âœ… **Contrast & Accessibility:** Maintain a good contrast between text and background.  

### Popular Font Choices:  
- **Serif Fonts:** Elegant, traditional (e.g., Times New Roman, Georgia).  
- **Sans-serif Fonts:** Clean, modern (e.g., Roboto, Helvetica, Open Sans).  
- **Monospace Fonts:** Technical, code-friendly (e.g., Courier New, Fira Code).  

## Font Pairing Principles  

The key to a well-balanced typography system is contrast and harmony. When pairing fonts:  

ðŸ”¹ **Use a primary font for headings** (e.g., a serif or display font).  
ðŸ”¹ **Use a secondary font for body text** (e.g., a sans-serif for better readability).  
ðŸ”¹ **Maintain visual contrast** while ensuring a cohesive look.  

### Example of Good Pairings:  
| Heading Font (Primary) | Body Font (Secondary) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Playfair Display       | Lato                 |
| Montserrat            | Open Sans            |
| Georgia               | Roboto               |

## Code Styling in Typography  

Good typography applies to code as well. Ensure:  
- Proper spacing for readability.  
- Syntax highlighting for better understanding.  
- A monospaced font to maintain alignment.

Hereâ€™s a simple Python example:  

```python
def greet(name: str):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
